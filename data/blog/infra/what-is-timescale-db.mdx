TimescaleDB is "PostgreSQL ++ for time series and events".

It extends PostgreSQL as a plugin, so it fully supports SQL while adding features for optimized time-series workloads.

It can be connected with params the same as PostgreSQL:

```bash
psql "postgres://tsdbadmin:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/tsdb?sslmode=require"
```

# Key concepts

## Hypertables

- Hypertables are PostgreSQL tables that automatically partition data by time, improving insert and query performance.
- They work like regular PostgreSQL tables but offer additional time-series management features.
- TimescaleDB handles partitioning transparently, simplifying data interaction.
