The html structure below has an issue: the blue box is taking the full height of the red container and the yellow box is overflowing from the red box.

The first level 3 div (`h-full`) tries to inherit the height of its closest flex ancestor. Since level 2 doesn’t have an explicit height, `h-full` makes it expand to the full height of level 1 (the flex container).

Because the first level 3 div already takes full height, the second one gets pushed beyond the level 2 div’s bounds, causing overflow.

```html
<!-- Level 1 -->
<div class="flex h-full bg-red-100">
  <!-- Level 2 -->
  <div class="bg-green-100">
    <!-- Level 3: Takes full height -->
    <div class="h-full bg-blue-100">Content 1</div>

    <!-- Level 3: Has margin but no height constraints -->
    <div class=" bg-yellow-100">Content 2</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

How to Fix It? Use `flex flex-col`:

```html
<div class="flex h-full bg-red-100">
  <div class="flex-col justify-between bg-green-100">
    <div class="h-full bg-blue-100">Content 1</div>
    <div class=" bg-yellow-100">Content 2</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Key takeaways:

- `h-full` inherits height but needs a defined parent height.
- `flex flex-col` helps prevent children from taking all space. `flex-col` means the children will stack vertically(the final output looks like a column)
- `overflow-auto` prevents content from overflowing outside the parent and adds scrollbars when needed.
