https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html#reactive

Unlike a `ref` which wraps the inner value in a special object, `reactive()` makes an **object** itself reactive.

It only works for object types (objects, arrays, and collection types such as Map and Set).

```js
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
```

```html
<button @click="state.count++">{{ state.count }}</button>
```
