Vue 3 introduces two new APIs for watching reactive data: `watch` and `watchEffect`. In this article, we will explore the differences between them and when to use each one.

## watch

`watch` is a more powerful and flexible API for watching reactive data. It allows you to watch multiple sources and react to changes in a more granular way.

Here's an example of using `watch` to watch a single reactive property:

```js
import { ref, watch } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

watch(count, (newValue, oldValue) => {
  console.log(`Count changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}`)
})

// Example: updating count
count.value++ // Logs: Count changed from 0 to 1
```

You can also watch multiple sources:

```js
import { ref, watch } from 'vue'

const firstName = ref('John')
const lastName = ref('Doe')

watch([firstName, lastName], ([newFirst, newLast], [oldFirst, oldLast]) => {
  console.log(`Name changed from ${oldFirst} ${oldLast} to ${newFirst} ${newLast}`)
})

// Example: updating names
firstName.value = 'Jane' // Logs: Name changed from John Doe to Jane Doe
```

## watchEffect

`watchEffect` is a simpler API that automatically tracks reactive dependencies and re-runs the effect whenever they change. It is more declarative and concise than `watch`.

```js
import { ref, watchEffect } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

watchEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Count is now: ${count.value}`)
})

// Example: updating count
count.value++ // Logs: Count is now: 1
```

Unlike watch, watchEffect runs immediately when declared and automatically tracks all reactive dependencies inside its callback.
