## 纳瓦尔

幸福是可以习得的。最近在反复学习《纳瓦尔宝典》第二部分——幸福，争取做到入心、入脑、入魂。

### 幸福 > 健康 > 财富

> The three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness. We pursue them in that order, but their importance is reverse.
>
> 生活中最重要的三件事是财富、健康和幸福。我们按这个顺序追求它们，但它们的重要性是相反的。

### 欲望

> Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.
>
> 欲望是你与自己订下的契约，在得到你想要的之前都不会快乐。

> The idea that changing the outside world will bring lasting happiness is a fundamental delusion we all suffer from, including me. We repeatedly make the mistake of thinking, "I'll be happy when I get that thing," whatever it is.
>
> 以为改变外部世界能带来持久的快乐，这是我们所有人的根本幻觉。我们反复犯同样的错误，认为“当我得到那个东西时，我就会快乐。”

> Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something.
>
> 幸福是当你不再感到生活中缺少什么东西的时候。当没有缺失的时候，你就不会动念去追悔过去或规划未来。

> Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image? If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous.
>
> 你真的想成为那个人，以及他所有反应、欲望、家庭、幸福水平、生活观、自我形象吗？如果你不愿意彻底、24小时、100%地改变自己，成为那个人，那么嫉妒就没有意义。

> Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. if you view yourself as a bacteria or an amoeba—or if you view all of your works as writing on water or building castles in the sand, then you have no expectation for how life should “actually” be. Life is just the way it is. When you accept that, you have no cause to be happy or unhappy.
>
> 自然中本没有幸或不幸。如果你把自己看作一个细菌或一个单细胞生物，或者把你所有的工作看作是在水上写字或在沙中盖楼，那就不会对生活“应该”是什么样抱有期望。生活就是这样，当你接受这一点时，你就不会因为幸福或不幸福而感到困扰。

> The world is such an amazing place. As humans, we’re used to taking everything for granted. Like what you and I are doing right now. We’re sitting indoors, wearing clothes, well-fed, and communicating with each other through space and time. We should be two monkeys sitting in the jungle right now watching the sun going down, asking ourselves where we are going to sleep.
>
> 世界如此美妙。作为人类，我们习惯于对一切视而不见。就像你我正所做的：我们坐在屋内，穿着衣服，吃得饱饱的，跨越时空与彼此交流。我们本该是丛林里的两只猴子，看着太阳落山，想着今晚在哪睡觉。

### 用好的方式解释世界

> Happiness is a choice you make and a skill you develop. We think of ourselves as fixed and the world as malleable, but it’s really we who are malleable and the world is largely fixed. Memory and identity are burdens from the past preventing us from living freely in the present.
>
> 幸福是一种选择，也是一种技能。我们把自己看作固定不变的，世界是可塑的；但实际上是我们自己可塑的，世界基本上是固定的。记忆和身份是过去对我们的负担，阻止我们自由地活在当下。

> The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgments. To a tree, there is no concept of right or wrong, good or bad. You’re born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences and stimulations (lights, colors, and sounds), and then you die. How you choose to interpret them is up to you—you have that choice.
>
> 世界只是反映了你的感受。现实是中性的。现实没有评判。对一棵树来说，没有对或错、好或坏。你出生了，你有一整套感官体验和应激反应，然后你死了。选择如何解释世界，完全取决于你自己。

> Just being very aware in every moment. If I catch myself judging somebody, I can stop myself and say, “What’s the positive interpretation of this?” I used to get annoyed about things. Now I always look for the positive side of it. It used to take a rational effort. It used to take a few seconds for me to come up with a positive. Now I can do it sub-second.
>
> 时刻警觉。如果我发现自己在评判别人，我可以停下来，对自己说：“这件事的积极解释是什么？” 以前我会对事情感到恼火。现在我总是寻找积极的一面。以前要思考几秒，现在可以瞬间完成。

### 平静

> When a lot of people say happiness, they mean joy or bliss, but I’ll take peace.
>
> 很多人谈幸福，是指快乐或喜悦，但我会选择平静。

> A happy person isn’t someone who’s happy all the time. It’s someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don’t lose their innate peace.
>
> 一个幸福的人并不是一个总是快乐的人。而是能够轻松解释所有发生的事情，让自己不失平静。

> “All of man’s troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself.” If you could just sit for thirty minutes and be happy, you are successful. That is a very powerful place to be, but very few of us get there.
>
> “所有人的麻烦都源于他们无法独自静坐于屋内。” 如果你能坐三十分钟并感到快乐，你就是成功的。这是一个非常强大的状态，很少有人能达到。

### 接受

> Most of our suffering comes from avoidance. Most of the suffering from a cold shower is the tip-toeing your way in. Once you’re in, you’re in. It’s not suffering. It’s just cold. Your body saying it’s cold is different than your mind saying it’s cold. Acknowledge your body saying it’s cold. Look at it. Deal with it. Accept it, but don’t mentally suffer over it. Taking a cold shower for two minutes isn’t going to kill you.
>
> 大多数痛苦来自逃避。洗冷水澡时，痛苦来自于小心翼翼地走进去。一旦你进去了，你就进去了。这不是痛苦。只是冷。你的身体说冷和你的心说冷是不同的。承认你的身体说冷。看看它。处理它。接受它，但不让内心痛苦。洗两分钟的冷水澡不会要你的命。

> Just sit there and you close your eyes for at least one hour a day. You surrender to whatever happens—don’t make any effort whatsoever. You make no effort for something, and you make no effort against anything. If there are thoughts running through your mind, you let the thoughts run.
>
> 每天闭眼坐至少一小时。顺其自然——不要做任何努力。不要为任何事情努力，也不要与任何事情对抗。如果脑海中有念头，就让念头来。

> One hack is stepping back and looking at previous bits of suffering I’ve had in my life. I write them down. “Last time you broke up with somebody, last time you had a business failure, last time you had a health issue, what happened?” I can trace the growth and improvement that came from it years later.
>
> 一个技巧是回顾生活中的一些痛苦经历。我把它们写下来。“上次你和某人分手，上次你生意失败，上次你生病，发生了什么？” 我可以追寻到几年后从中得到的成长和进步。

### 当下

> Our lives are a blink of a firefly in the night. You’re just barely here. You have to make the most of every minute, which doesn’t mean you chase some stupid desire for your entire life. What it means is every second you have on this planet is very precious, and it’s your responsibility to make sure you’re happy and interpreting everything in the best possible way.
>
> 我们的生命就像萤火虫在夜空中的一闪。你只是匆匆路过。你必须珍惜每一分钟，这并不意味着你要用一生去追求一些愚蠢欲望。你在这个星球上的每一秒都非常宝贵，你有责任确保自己快乐，并以最好的方式解释一切。

> There is no legacy. There’s nothing to leave. We’re all going to be gone. Our children will be gone. Our works will be dust. Our civilizations will be dust. Our planet will be dust. Our solar system will be dust. In the grand scheme of things, the Universe has been around for ten billion years. It’ll be around for another ten billion years
>
> 没有遗产。没有什么会留下。我们都会消失。我们的孩子会消失。我们的作品会变成尘埃。我们的文明会变成尘埃。我们的星球会变成尘埃。我们的太阳系会变成尘埃。在宇宙的宏伟蓝图中，宇宙已经存在了十亿年。它还会存在另外十亿年。

> Happiness to me is mainly not suffering, not desiring, not thinking too much about the future or the past, really embracing the present moment and the reality of what is, and the way it is.
>
> 对我来说，幸福主要是不痛苦，不渴望，不过多地思考未来或过去，真正拥抱当下，接受现实，接受事物本来的样子。

> If there’s something you want to do later, do it now. There is no “later.”
>
> 如果你想要做某事，现在就去做。没有“以后”。

### 做自己

> Advice to my younger self: “Be exactly who you are.”
>
> 给年轻时的自己：“做你自己。”

> Courage isn’t charging into a machine gun nest. Courage is not caring what other people think.
>
> 勇气不是冲进机枪阵地。勇气是不在乎别人的看法。

> If it’s your internal purpose, the thing you most want to do, then sure, you’ll be happy doing it. But an externally inflicted purpose, like “society wants me to do X,” “I am the first son of the first son of this, so I should do Y,” or “I have this debt or burden I took on,” I don’t think it will make you happy.
>
> 你在做内心想做的事时是幸福的。但若是外界强加的，比如“社会希望我这样”，“作为家族长子应该那样”，或“我有债务或负担”，我认为这不会让你幸福。

> A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest?
>
> 一个个人指标：一天中有多少时间是在出于义务而非兴趣做事？

### 好习惯

> If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.
>
> 如果你不想自己与某人共度一生，就不要与他们共事一天。

> When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you. When playing, surround yourself with people happier than you.
>
> 工作时，与比你更成功的人在一起。玩耍时，与比你更快乐的人在一起。

> Tell your friends you’re a happy person. Then, you’ll be forced to conform to it.
>
> 告诉你的朋友你很幸福。然后，你会强迫自己符合这种状态。

> Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind.
>
> 冥想是精神上的间歇性断食。

> The harder the workout, the easier the day.
>
> 锻炼越辛苦，一天越轻松。

> I try to get more sunlight on my skin. I look up and smile.
>
> 我尽可能多地晒太阳。我抬头并微笑。

一句话结论：良好的人际关系最能让人幸福。

## 苏格拉底

> "You seem, Antiphon, to imagine that happiness consists in luxury and extravagance. But my belief is that to have no wants is divine; to have as few as possible comes next to the divine."
>
> “安提丰，你似乎认为幸福在于奢侈和铺张。但我认为，无欲为神，欲望越少越接近神。”

## 阿德勒

人的一切烦恼都来自于人际关系。
