[[42] Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

**Key Concept: Two Pointers with Max Heights** - Water at any position is determined by the minimum of the maximum heights on both sides minus the current height. Use two pointers to track max heights from both ends.

**Algorithm:** Move the pointer with smaller max height inward, as it determines the water level at that position.

```python
# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
# of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The elevation map traps 6 units of rain water.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
#
# Constraints:
# n == height.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
# 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0

        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        left_max, right_max = height[left], height[right]
        water = 0

        while left < right:
            # Move pointer with smaller max height
            # Water level is determined by the smaller of the two max heights
            if left_max < right_max:
                left += 1
                left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
                # Water trapped at current position
                water += left_max - height[left]
            else:
                right -= 1
                right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
                water += right_max - height[right]

        return water

# Alternative approach using left and right max arrays:
class Solution2:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        if n == 0:
            return 0

        # Precompute max heights from left and right
        left_max = [0] * n
        right_max = [0] * n

        left_max[0] = height[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            left_max[i] = max(left_max[i - 1], height[i])

        right_max[n - 1] = height[n - 1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            right_max[i] = max(right_max[i + 1], height[i])

        water = 0
        for i in range(n):
            water += min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]

        return water

# Two-pointer: Time O(n), Space O(1)
# Array approach: Time O(n), Space O(n)
```
