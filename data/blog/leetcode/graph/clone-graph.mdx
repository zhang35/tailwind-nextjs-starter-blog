[[133] Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

**Key Concept: Deep Copy with HashMap** - Use a hash map to track original node → cloned node mapping. This prevents creating duplicate clones and handles cycles properly.

**Pattern:** Essential pattern for cloning any graph structure (appears in linked list, tree, and graph problems).

```python
# Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep
# copy (clone) of the graph. Each node contains a value and a list of neighbors.
#
# class Node {
#     public int val;
#     public List<Node> neighbors;
# }
#
# Example 1:
# Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
# Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 100
# There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.

# Definition for a Node.
# class Node:
#     def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

class Solution:
    # Approach 1: DFS with HashMap
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return None

        # Map original node to cloned node
        cloned = {}

        def dfs(node):
            # If already cloned, return the clone
            if node in cloned:
                return cloned[node]

            # Create clone for current node
            clone = Node(node.val)
            cloned[node] = clone

            # Clone all neighbors
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                clone.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))

            return clone

        return dfs(node)

    # Approach 2: BFS with HashMap
    def cloneGraph2(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return None

        from collections import deque

        cloned = {node: Node(node.val)}
        queue = deque([node])

        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()

            for neighbor in current.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in cloned:
                    # Clone the neighbor
                    cloned[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)
                    queue.append(neighbor)

                # Add cloned neighbor to current clone's neighbors
                cloned[current].neighbors.append(cloned[neighbor])

        return cloned[node]

# Time Complexity: O(V + E) - visit each node and edge once
# Space Complexity: O(V) - hash map stores all nodes
#
# Key Pattern: HashMap for tracking original → clone mapping
# Essential for preventing infinite loops in graphs with cycles!
# This same pattern works for:
# - Copy List with Random Pointer (LC 138)
# - Clone Binary Tree with Random Pointer
# - Clone N-ary Tree
```
