[[739] Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

**Key Concept: Monotonic Stack** - Use a stack to maintain indices in decreasing order of temperatures. When we find a warmer day, pop all colder days from stack and calculate their waiting times. This is the **monotonic decreasing stack pattern**.

**Pattern:** Monotonic stack is crucial for "next greater/smaller element" problems.

```python
# Given an array of integers temperatures where temperatures[i] represents the
# daily temperatures on the ith day, return an array answer such that answer[i]
# is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer
# temperature. If there is no future day with a warmer temperature, keep answer[i] == 0.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
# Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
#
# Example 2:
# Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
# Output: [1,1,1,0]
#
# Example 3:
# Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
# Output: [1,1,0]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
# 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(temperatures)
        answer = [0] * n
        stack = []  # Stack stores indices

        for i in range(n):
            # While current temp is warmer than stack top
            while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
                prev_index = stack.pop()
                # Calculate days to wait
                answer[prev_index] = i - prev_index

            # Push current index
            stack.append(i)

        # Remaining indices in stack have no warmer day (already 0)
        return answer

# Time Complexity: O(n) - each index pushed and popped at most once
# Space Complexity: O(n) - stack in worst case
#
# Monotonic Stack Pattern:
# - Maintain indices in monotonically decreasing order (by temperature)
# - When we find a larger value, pop smaller values and process them
# - Push current index
#
# This pattern solves "next greater/smaller" problems efficiently!
#
# Related Problems:
# - Next Greater Element I & II (LC 496, 503)
# - Largest Rectangle in Histogram (LC 84)
# - Trapping Rain Water (LC 42) - can also use monotonic stack
#
# Key Insight: Instead of brute force O(n^2) checking all future days,
# use stack to efficiently find the next warmer day in O(n)
