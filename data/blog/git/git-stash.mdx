## Stash

Stash all changes:

```bash
git stash
```

Stash one file:

```bash
git stash push -m "Stash myfile" -- myfile.txt
```

The `--` separator is used when:

1. Disambiguating between a file and a branch name (if a file has the same name as a branch).
2. Ensuring arguments are interpreted as filenames rather than options.

## List

```bash
git stash list
```

## Apply

```bash
git stash pop
```

or

```bash
git stash apply
git stash apply stash@{1}
```
