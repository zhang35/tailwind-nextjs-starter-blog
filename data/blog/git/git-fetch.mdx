## Rebase local branch to remote main without switching branch

1. Fetch from origin and update the local main branch:

```bash
git fetch origin main:main
```

Without updating the local main branch:

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

2. Rebase the local main branch to the remote main branch:

```bash
git rebase main
```
