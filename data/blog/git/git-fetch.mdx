When working on a feature branch, you frequently need to update it with the latest changes from the `main` branch. This keeps your branch current and helps prevent large merge conflicts later.

There are two primary ways to integrate these changes: **rebasing** and **merging**. This guide shows you how to perform both workflows without having to check out your local `main` branch first.

## Option 1: Updating with `git rebase` (Linear History)

Rebasing rewrites your branch's history by replaying your commits on top of the latest commit from `main`. This results in a clean, linear history.

### Method 1: The `fetch` and `rebase` Workflow

This is a two-step approach that clearly separates downloading changes from applying them.

**Step 1: Fetch the latest from the remote `main` branch**
This command downloads changes from `origin` and updates your local remote-tracking branch, `origin/main`. It does not touch your local `main` branch or your current working branch.

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

**Step 2: Rebase your current branch onto `origin/main`**
Now that `origin/main` is up-to-date, you can rebase your current branch on top of it.

```bash
git rebase origin/main
```

### Method 2: The `pull --rebase` Shortcut

This single command achieves the same result by combining the fetch and rebase steps.

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

## Option 2: Updating with `git merge` (Preserves History)

Merging integrates the latest changes from `main` by creating a new "merge commit" in your feature branch. This preserves the exact history of when the two branches were combined.

### Method 1: The `fetch` and `merge` Workflow

Similar to rebasing, you can first fetch the changes and then merge them.

**Step 1: Fetch the latest from the remote `main` branch**
This is the same command as before, updating your `origin/main` remote-tracking branch.

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

**Step 2: Merge the changes into your current branch**
Instead of rebasing, you merge the updated `origin/main` into your branch.

```bash
git merge origin/main
```
This creates a merge commit in your feature branch's history.

### Method 2: The `git pull` Shortcut

By default, `git pull` is a shortcut for `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.

```bash
git pull origin main
```
This command fetches from `origin main` and merges the result into your current branch.

## Which Should You Use?

- **Rebase** if you prefer a clean, linear commit history without extra merge commits.
- **Merge** if you want to preserve the exact history and explicitly show when your branch synced with `main`.
