# Support Multiple Users

Global config ~/.gitconfig

```bash
[user]
    name = John Personal
    email = john@gmail.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
    path = ~/work/.gitconfig
```

Work specific config `~/work/.gitconfig`

```
[user]
    name = John Work
    email = john.doe@company.tld
```

# Test

Clone a repo into `~/work/test-repo`. Open the teminal and check the user email by:

```bash
% git config --get user.email
john.doe@company.tld
```

# Multiple SSH access solution

If you are using SSH to access the repos, follow these steps to generate a new SSH key for the work accounts:

1. [Check for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
2. [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
3. [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

For example, if you have generated a new key named `id_ed25519_work`, test it by running:

```bash
% ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -T git@github.com

Hi xxx! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Then append this section into `~/work/.gitconfig`:

```
[core]
    sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work -o IdentitiesOnly=yes
```
