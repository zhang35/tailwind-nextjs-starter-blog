```bash
git branch | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -D
```

This command will delete all branches except `main`:

1. `git branch`: Lists all local branches in your repository.
2. `grep -v "main"`: Filters out the line containing "main". `-v` inverts the match, so branches named main are excluded from the output.
3. `xargs git branch -D`: Takes the list of branches (excluding main) and passes each branch name as an argument to the git branch -D command. `git branch -D` forcibly deletes a branch, even if it hasnâ€™t been fully merged.
