## undefined

`undefined` is a **primitive value** automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.

```js
let x //create a variable but assign it no value
```

console.log(`x's value is ${x}`); //logs "x's value is undefined"

## null

In computer science, a `null` value represents a reference that points, generally intentionally, to a nonexistent or invalid **object** or address. The meaning of a null reference varies among language implementations.

In JavaScript, `null` is marked as one of the primitive values, because its behavior is seemingly primitive. However, when using the typeof operator, it returns "object".

```js
console.log(typeof null) // "object"
```

This is considered a bug, but one which cannot be fixed because it will break too many scripts.

## primitive value

In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types:

```js
string
number
bigint
boolean
symbol
undefined
null
```
