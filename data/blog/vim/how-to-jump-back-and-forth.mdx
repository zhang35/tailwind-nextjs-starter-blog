## Vim navigation

`Ctrl+o` navigate to the previous location in the jump list (think o as old)

`Ctrl+i` navigate to the next location in the jump list (i and o are usually next to each other)

`g;` go to the previous change location

`g,` go to the newer change location

`gi` place the cursor at the same position where it was left last time in the Insert mode

Use `:jumps` to view the jump list. See `:h jump-motions` for more details.

## VSCode built-in navigation

You can also use VSCode's built-in navigation feature:

```
Ctrl + - ... navigate back

Ctrl + Shift + - ... navigate forward
```
