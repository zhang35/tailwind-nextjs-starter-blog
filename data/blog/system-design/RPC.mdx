# RPC

A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) allows a program to execute a procedure on another computer or server as if it were a local function call, abstracting away the complexities of network communication.

```python
from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))
print("Listening on port 8000...")
server.register_function(add, "add")
server.register_function(multiply, "multiply")
server.serve_forever()

```

```python
import xmlrpc.client

with xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/") as proxy:
    print("3 + 5 = %d" % proxy.add(3, 5))
    print("3 * 5 = %d" % proxy.multiply(3, 5))

```

# gRPC

RPC vs gRPC

| Feature            | gRPC                                         | RPC (General)                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Serialization | Protocol Buffers (binary)                    | Various (JSON, XML, Protobuf)                                      |
| Transport Protocol | HTTP/2 (primarily)                           | Varies (TCP, UDP, HTTP)                                            |
| Performance        | Generally faster                             | Varies depending on implementation                                 |
| Streaming          | Supports streaming                           | May or may not support streaming                                   |
| Complexity         | Steeper learning curve                       | Varies, can be simpler                                             |
| Language Support   | Good support for many languages              | Varies, depends on implementation                                  |
| Microservices      | Well-suited for microservices                | Can be used for microservices, but may not be the best choice      |

In essence: gRPC is a modern, high-performance RPC framework built for efficient communication, especially in distributed systems and microservices. While traditional RPC is a broader concept, it can be less performant than gRPC due to its reliance on potentially less efficient data formats and transport protocols.
