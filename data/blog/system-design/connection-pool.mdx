# What is connection pooling

Connection pooling uses **a cache of database connections** that can be reused when future requests to the database are required.

# Advantages

1. Save memory: with PostgreSQL, each new connection can take up to 1.3MB in memory.
2. Avoid max connection limits: PostgreSQL allows 100 concurrent connections by default. Exceeding the stated number will result in an error stating "too many clients already".
3. Faster response time: no need to build a new TCP connection.
4. Better manage traffic peaks without causing outages.
